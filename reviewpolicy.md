# Alliteration Ink's Review Policy
 
![](aink_logo.png "Alliteration Ink")  \  

## Need For This Policy

The point of a review is to steer people toward books they’d enjoy, and away from those they would not. (I wrote years ago about [the necessity
of having honest reviews](http://www.adotas.com/2007/11/keeping-it-real-customer-service-as-interactive-advertising/), and my opinion hasn't changed. As both a publisher and author, I am **not** interested in tricking anyone into buying a book. I am interested in selling them a book they'll **enjoy**.

It is *critical* that you, the reader, can trust my reviews and reviews of my books.

Always.

## Policy For Reviewers

As Alliteration Ink:

1.  I will, at my discretion, provide review copies to reviewers.  Reviewers in this sense may be private individuals, companies, professional bloggers, or regular folks. Reviewers should disclose that they received a review copy.
2.  I will encourage all readers to honestly review the books I publish.  This means that if you like it, say what you liked. If you don’t
 like a book, say what you didn’t like. Tastes vary; I remember a local movie reviewer whose tastes were almost exactly opposite my own, their reviews were still *useful* since I knew what the reviewer did and did not care for.
3.  I will never, ever pay (or otherwise provide extra compensation aside from the review copy itself) for a good or positive review.  Likewise, a negative review will not disqualify someone from getting a review copy in the future.
4.  I may ask individuals if they would review a book for consideration for a recommendation for an award. I will not trade recommendations
 or directly solicit recommendations for awards. Being provided a copy for consideration is not presumed to be equal to a recommendation for an award, whether I provide the copy to another or someone provides a copy of their book to me.
5.  Authors, editors, and other persons working with Alliteration Ink should likewise never pay for a positive review.
6.  Authors should never review their own books and stories. Authors who are in anthologies and review the other stories in that anthology must, at a bare minimum, disclose that they have a story in the anthology. I *discourage* reviewing anthologies you're in other than on your own blog or social media page.
7.  Those who have a connection to the author(s) in the book(s) they’re reviewing should disclose that fact at the beginning of the review.
