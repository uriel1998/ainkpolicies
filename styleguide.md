These are style guide notes for Alliteration Ink

* Include full contact information at the top of the story
* Include a bio of no more than 100 words at the end of the story.

* The byline should be centered and just the author's name.  No bolding or font size changes.
* Scene breaks should be centered with either `***` or `###`
* Do not use spaces or tabs to indent paragraphs.
* Smart quotes, please.  Yes, I hate them too, but it's even harder to fix them.
