These are style guide notes for Alliteration Ink

* Include full contact information at the top of the story
* Include a bio of no more than 100 words at the end of the story.
* Only ever underline if it is **required**. Do *not* underline when you want to italicize. Italics are italics, bold is bold.
* Title should be centered, Title Case Capitalization. No bolding or font size changes.
* The byline should be centered and just the author's name. No bolding or font size changes.
* Scene breaks should be centered with either `***` or `###`
* Spelling should be consistently English or American within each work.
* Do not use spaces or tabs to indent paragraphs.
* Smart quotes, please. Yes, I hate them too, but it's even harder to fix them.
* Put the word END in all caps, centered, at the end of the story.
* Use three periods for ellipses and -- for m-dashes.
* I have just recently switched to one space after periods. See [http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html)
* Yes, use the Oxford comma.
* Because I work with anthologies and multiple formats, When asked for edits, please provide them like such:
	In the line "Do not use spaces or tabs to indent paragraphs" change it to:
	"For the love of all that is beautiful, do not use spaces or tabs to indent paragraphs"
