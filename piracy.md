# Alliteration Ink's Statement on Piracy

## Pricing and DRM

Whenever possible, the content created by myself or authors that I'm publishing is packaged without DRM, and reasonably priced. I look at the current market, and think about how many hours of entertainment the work is likely to give someone - then decide on a price for it. For example, while I love getting a fancy $5 coffee, I'm only going to get an hour or so worth of enjoyment out of it. Give me a good anthology or novel - usually 7 to 10 hours worth of reading time - and that's worth a hell of a lot.

I know that DRM is doomed to failure - I've written an entire series of blog articles on it. But those who are wanting to steal our books are going to. In the meantime, DRM keeps our *real* readers from truly *owning* our books, or reading them on whatever device they choose. Yes, I'm going to remind you that "The author of these stories worked hard on them. By purchasing this work, you become a patron of the arts and support independent authors bringing you quality entertainment." I'm not going to restrict your ability to read the book because some people can't be bothered to support the things they like.

## Paying For It

I know, it's easy to find torrents of books, movies, and music. Thing is, if you want more of those books, movies, and TV shows you like, you've got to pay for them *somehow*. I know three, maybe four authors who are able to support themselves full-time doing fiction writing. Because it's their full-time job, they're able to spend all day working on books. The rest of us get to slag through day jobs just like you - and *then* try to find time to write. **Imagine how much more your favorite artists and writers would produce if they didn't have to deal with the crappy day job.**

Pirates keep telling me that it's all about increasing awareness and exposure. And that's sort of true... even though "exposure" does a crappy job of paying your rent. So here's my solution:

**If you've torrented something, and you love the work, *go buy a copy for a friend*. Then buy the next thing that artist puts out. And buy a copy of *that* for a different friend.**

## After You Pirated

If you first came across our work through piracy or "sharing", great! Help support us **now** and **in the future.** Alliteration Ink is a small outfit. It's me - [Steve Saus](http://stevesaus.com) - and those who are working with me on any individual project. Buy a copy of the actual book, both so that we can pay our authors and so that we know what you're wanting to read. And if you can't buy the book this time, *buy the next book by those authors.*

Because this business is so small, our overhead is really low. Practically all the proceeds go to the author - so when you pay for it, the author(s) get most of the payment.
